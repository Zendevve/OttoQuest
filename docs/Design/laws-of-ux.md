# Laws of UX Reference

A collection of best practices that designers can consider when building user interfaces.

---

## Aesthetic-Usability Effect

Users often perceive aesthetically pleasing design as design that's more usable.

**Takeaways:**
- An aesthetically pleasing design creates a positive response in people's brains and leads them to believe the design actually works better
- People are more tolerant of minor usability issues when the design is aesthetically pleasing
- Visually pleasing design can mask usability problems

---

## Choice Overload

The tendency for people to get overwhelmed when presented with a large number of options.

**Takeaways:**
- Too many options hurts users' decision-making ability
- Enable side-by-side comparison when comparison is necessary
- Prioritize content shown at any given moment (e.g. featured product)
- Provide tools for narrowing down choices (e.g. search and filtering)

---

## Chunking

A process by which individual pieces of information are broken down and grouped together in a meaningful whole.

**Takeaways:**
- Chunking enables users to easily scan content
- Structure content into visually distinct groups with clear hierarchy
- Group content into distinctive modules with visual separation

---

## Cognitive Load

The amount of mental resources needed to understand and interact with an interface.

**Takeaways:**
- When information exceeds available mental space, tasks become more difficult
- **Intrinsic load**: effort to absorb information relevant to goal
- **Extraneous load**: mental processing that doesn't help understand content
- Reduce extraneous load by removing unnecessary design elements

---

## Doherty Threshold

Productivity soars when a computer and its users interact at a pace (<400ms) that ensures neither has to wait.

**Takeaways:**
- Provide system feedback within 400ms
- Use perceived performance to improve response time
- Animation visually engages people while loading
- Progress bars help make wait times tolerable
- Purposefully adding delay can increase perceived value and trust

---

## Fitts's Law

The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.

**Takeaways:**
- Touch targets should be large enough for accurate selection
- Touch targets should have ample spacing
- Place targets in easily acquired areas
- Fast movements and small targets result in greater error rates

---

## Flow

The mental state of being fully immersed in energized focus, involvement, and enjoyment.

**Takeaways:**
- Flow occurs when task difficulty balances with skill level
- Task too difficult = frustration; too easy = boredom
- Provide feedback so user knows what has been accomplished
- Remove unnecessary friction

---

## Goal-Gradient Effect

The tendency to approach a goal increases with proximity to the goal.

**Takeaways:**
- The closer users are to completing, the faster they work
- Providing artificial progress helps motivation
- Provide clear indication of progress

---

## Hick's Law

The time to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.

**Takeaways:**
- Minimize choices when response times are critical
- Break complex tasks into smaller steps
- Highlight recommended options
- Use progressive onboarding for new users
- Don't simplify to the point of abstraction

---

## Jakob's Law

Users prefer your site to work the same way as other sites they already know.

**Takeaways:**
- Users transfer expectations from familiar products
- Leverage existing mental models for superior experiences
- When making changes, allow users to continue using familiar version temporarily

---

## Law of Common Region

Elements sharing an area with a clearly defined boundary tend to be perceived as groups.

**Takeaways:**
- Common region creates clear structure
- Add borders around elements to create grouping
- Define backgrounds to create common region

---

## Law of Proximity

Objects near each other tend to be grouped together.

**Takeaways:**
- Proximity establishes relationship with nearby objects
- Close elements are perceived to share similar functionality
- Users understand and organize information faster

---

## Law of Prägnanz

People perceive complex images as the simplest form possible (requires least cognitive effort).

**Takeaways:**
- The eye likes to find simplicity and order
- Simple figures are better remembered than complex ones
- The eye simplifies complex shapes into unified shapes

---

## Law of Similarity

The eye perceives similar elements as a complete picture, shape, or group.

**Takeaways:**
- Visually similar elements will be perceived as related
- Color, shape, size, orientation, movement signal grouping
- Differentiate links and navigation from normal text

---

## Law of Uniform Connectedness

Visually connected elements are perceived as more related.

**Takeaways:**
- Group similar functions via colors, lines, frames
- Use connecting references (lines, arrows) to create visual connection
- Show context or emphasize relationships between items

---

## Miller's Law

The average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in working memory.

**Takeaways:**
- Don't use "magical number seven" to justify unnecessary limitations
- Organize content into smaller chunks
- Short-term memory varies by individual and context

---

## Occam's Razor

Among competing hypotheses, choose the one with the fewest assumptions.

**Takeaways:**
- Best method for reducing complexity is to avoid it
- Remove as many elements as possible without compromising function
- Consider complete only when nothing more can be removed

---

## Paradox of the Active User

Users never read manuals but start using software immediately.

**Takeaways:**
- Users want to complete immediate tasks, not read documentation
- Make guidance accessible throughout the experience
- Design contextual help (e.g. tooltips) for active users

---

## Pareto Principle

Roughly 80% of effects come from 20% of causes.

**Takeaways:**
- Inputs and outputs are often not evenly distributed
- Focus majority of effort on areas bringing largest benefits

---

## Parkinson's Law

Any task will inflate until all available time is spent.

**Takeaways:**
- Limit task time to what users expect
- Reducing duration improves user experience
- Use autofill to save time and prevent task inflation

---

## Peak-End Rule

People judge experience based on how they felt at its peak and end, not the average.

**Takeaways:**
- Pay attention to most intense points and final moments
- Design to delight at important moments
- People recall negative experiences more vividly

---

## Postel's Law

Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send.

**Takeaways:**
- Be empathetic, flexible, and tolerant of user actions
- Anticipate virtually anything in terms of input
- Accept variable input, translate to meet requirements, provide feedback

---

## Serial Position Effect

Users best remember first and last items in a series.

**Takeaways:**
- Place least important items in the middle
- Position key actions on far left and right

---

## Tesler's Law (Conservation of Complexity)

For any system there is a certain amount of complexity which cannot be reduced.

**Takeaways:**
- Inherent complexity must be assumed by system or user
- Lift burden from users by handling complexity in design
- Don't build for idealized, rational users

---

## Von Restorff Effect

When multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs is most likely remembered.

**Takeaways:**
- Make important information visually distinctive
- Use restraint to avoid competing emphasis
- Don't rely only on color for contrast (accessibility)

---

## Zeigarnik Effect

People remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks.

**Takeaways:**
- Invite discovery by signifying additional content
- Artificial progress motivates completion
- Provide clear progress indication

---

## Working Memory

A cognitive system that temporarily holds information needed to complete tasks.

**Takeaways:**
- Limited to 4-7 chunks, fades after 20-30 seconds
- Support recognition over recall
- Place burden of memory on system, not user
